## Background

At Lendsqr, many of our lenders use web apps to reach over half a million customers. At this scale, we use React with TypeScript and SCSS as its frontend software development stack which allows us to rapidly ideate and release features rapidly and reliably.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- REACT
- SCSS (Sass)

## Features

In this web app, you can browse through 4 pages:
- Login
- Dashboard
- User
- User Details

- The [login page]() allows the user login in with thier username and password, which prompt them to the Dashboard page. The [dashboard]() shows the users table where you can find short details of the use, like their phone number, email, date joined and more. 

- You can click on the more icon at the last edge of the table to view more details about. When you click the [view deatils](), it takes you to a page where in-depth details of the user like employment status, stats and more

- You can also navigte through the pages using the sidebar at the left of all pages

- In the [user page](), whem you clicked on all the filter icon at the top section of the table, it opens a filter container to help filter users based on your what user you would like to see. (The filter isn't working, it's just a demo but that's the general premise of the filter popup)

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
