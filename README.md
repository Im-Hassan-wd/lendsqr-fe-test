## Background

At Lendsqr, many of our lenders use web apps to reach over half a million customers. At this scale, we use React with TypeScript and SCSS as its frontend software development stack which allows us to rapidly ideate and release features rapidly and reliably.

### Built With

<!-- This section should list any major frameworks that you built your project using. Here are a few examples.-->

- REACT
- SCSS (Sass)

## Features

In this web app, you can browse through 4 pages:
Login
Dashboard
User
User Details

- The "login page" allows the user login in with thier username and password, which prompt them to the Dashboard page. The "dashboard" shows the users table where you can find short details of the use, like their phone number, email, date joined and more. 

- You can click on the more icon at the last edge of the table to view more details about. When you click the "view deatils", it takes you to a page where in-depth details of the user like employment status, stats and more

- You can also navigte through the pages using the sidebar at the left of all pages

- In the "user page", whem you clicked on all the filter icon at the top section of the table, it opens a filter container to help filter users based on your what user you would like to see. (The filter isn't working, it's just a demo but that's the general premise of the filter popup)
